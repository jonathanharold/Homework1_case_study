  ## How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
  
 Charles Parker was local businessman, succeeded in merging the two competitors into a single entity—Orange County Title Company. C.E. Parker became the president of Orange County Title, which, starting in 1909, would pay a cash dividend every year for the rest of the century and would become one of the first abstract companies in California to qualify to issue title insurance policies.

 ## How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

In 1988, First American began to operate internationally with the opening of title insurance offices in Canada.
First American continued to develop international operations and was the first title insurance provider in Mexico, Korea and Hong Kong, and had the leading market share in Australia and England. This long lasting growth and experience has led to First American Title becoming one of the most successful, diverse, and cash heavy companies in the space allowing for lots of research and devoplment.


## Business Activities:

  ## What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
  Just in the last few years, First American Title has been developing new technologies to better customers and stream line the title process by using blockchain. Some of the key issues blockchain will resolve in this industry are but not limted to: 

  * Real estate corruption
  * Costly property transfer fees 
  * Prohibitive mortgage financing.

 ## Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
  
  Title insurance is a niche but sizable market in the US, with $11bn in premiums paid in 2018. Title insurance exists mainly to protect a property owner and/or mortgage lender's financial interest in a real estate transaction agaisnt loss from title defects. Title defects include outstanding liens, easments, or other encumbrances unaccounted for at the time of the transaction. 

## What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Today, the US property registration system is organized as a "chain of title," with historical transfers of property title being manually recorded on an ongoing paper trail this is stored in a local jurisdictions. The existing system introduces three problems 

* Decentrailization of property records
* Fallibility of paper-based recording
* Elevated property transaction costs

With blockchain, First American Corperation, has to potentcial to eleminate transational risk from the existing land registration system. This would help resolve the following issues intoday's system.

Property records validated by consensus help eliminate paper-based records. This will make paper based records a system of the past. Also important to note that no disagreement as to the ledger's integrity would arise due to it runnning on a consensus.

A shared database of real estate transactions could make property title searches more transparent and more efficient. This reduces the need for title insurers to build and maintain electronic title plants that are meant for indexing public real estate records.
